# KerPIC - Photo Selector

A web-based photo comparison and selection tool to help you quickly choose the best images from similar shots.

> **Why "KerPIC"?** Because we're basically terrible at naming things, but accidentally stumbled into something clever! üéØ The "PIC" obviously stands for pictures, and if you flip the syllables (Ker-PIC ‚Üí PIC-Ker), you get "picker" - which is exactly what this app does. It's either genius or we got really lucky. We're going with genius.

## Quick Start

1. **Clone and setup**:
   ```bash
   # Copy environment variables
   cp .env.example .env
   
   # Edit .env to point to your photos directory
   # Example: PHOTOS_PATH=/home/user/Pictures
   ```

2. **Run with Docker**:
   ```bash
   # Build and start
   docker-compose up --build
   
   # Access the application
   open http://localhost:3000
   ```

## Features

- **Folder Browser**: Navigate through your photo directories
- **Image Grid**: Select multiple images for comparison
- **Side-by-Side Comparison**: Compare images efficiently with keyboard controls
- **Smart File Operations**: Preserve metadata, handle conflicts automatically
- **Keyboard-First**: Optimized for rapid navigation and selection

## Usage Workflow

1. **Browse**: Navigate to a folder containing images
2. **Select**: Choose 2+ similar images you want to compare
3. **Compare**: Use keyboard shortcuts to efficiently pick the best ones:

   - `Space`: Set current candidate as new best
   - `S`: Save current image to final selection
   - `X`: Reject current image
4. **Save**: Selected images are moved to a "saved" subfolder
